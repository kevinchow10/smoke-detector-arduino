# smoke-detector-arduino
The device created is Exposure of People to Smoke  Detector. The detector functions to record the amount of smoke  present and whether there is a person present. By observing these  two factors, the exposure of the smoke towards the people can be  determined. Alongside the smoke, the temperature is observed to  create relation between the production of smoke to temperature as  well. The device utilizes two Arduino UNO R3 and three  sensors (PIR motion sensor, MQ135 gas sensor, and DHT11  temperature sensor). From the sensor inputs, a data log is  created with time of each observation using Real Time  Clock to a SD card for evaluation.
